            pierce being used as an otomatopoeia is so good. like the sound of
            verbalizing the word "pierce" causes a piercing sound.

            i think music is a good thing to keep in mind when analyzing
            somebody. i don't mean analyze in a judgey way- i mean analyze in a
            "learning-how-somebody-works" way. in a way i see this like a
            language, being so familiar with this art form that you can
            understand somebody through sound.

            i kept thinking about things that i don't think i would be
            reasonably able to come to a conclusion on, so decided to make a
            sort of blog thing. i have a history of programming, and have
            thought about making a website like this many times in the past but
            never ended up following through. today i decided to change that. my
            goal here is to create something cool and unique while avoiding
            javascript.
