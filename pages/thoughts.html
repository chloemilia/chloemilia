            i just found this awesome tool that's able to split audio on
            silence. very useful for chopping up mixes locally to make them into
            individual tracks. it's called

            pierce being used as an otomatopoeia is so good. like the sound of
            verbalizing the word "pierce" causes a piercing sound.

            i think music is a good thing to keep in mind when analyzing
            somebody. i don't mean analyze in a judgey way- i mean analyze in a
            "learning-how-somebody-works" way. in a way i see this like a
            language, being so familiar with this art form that you can
            understand somebody through sound.

            i kept thinking about things that i don't think i would be
            reasonably able to come to a conclusion on, so decided to make a
            sort of blog thing. i have a history of programming, and have
            thought about making a website like this many times in the past but
            never ended up following through. today i decided to change that. my
            goal here is to create something cool and unique while avoiding
            javascript.
