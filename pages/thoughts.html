            i kept thinking about things that i don't think i would be
            reasonably able to come to a conclusion on, so decided to make a
            sort of blog thing. i have a history of programming, and have
            thought about making a website like this many times in the past but
            never ended up following through. today i decided to change that. my
            goal here is to create something cool and unique while avoiding
            javascript.
